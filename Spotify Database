# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. Top 10 artist based on popularity

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#2. Whats the average duration of songs by artist?

SELECT artist_name, ROUND(avg(duration_ms)) AS avg_duration FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#1. What are the top 10 artists according to popularity?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#2. Whats the average duration of songs by artist?

SELECT artist_name, ROUND(avg(duration_ms)) AS avg_duration FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#3. How many songs contain the word love in their name?

SELECT track_name, count(track_name) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name LIKE '%love%';

#4. What songs were featured and what was their popularity?

SELECT track_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name LIKE '%feat%';

#5. Who is the artist with the most danceable songs and whats the average danceability?

SELECT artist_name, avg(danceability) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 1;

#6. What artists have 3 or more songs on the database?

#7. What are the max and min levels of energy?

SELECT distinct track_name, MAX(energy) AS max, MIN(energy) AS min FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#8. What are the songs that have at least a danceability of 0.700, or energy levels of 0.600?

SELECT track_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE danceability >0.699
OR energy >0.599;

#9. Which songs were the 10 loudest while having a tempo of less than a 100?

SELECT track_name, loudness, tempo FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo< 100
ORDER BY loudness DESC
LIMIT 10;

#10. Which songs include the word you on their name and whats their popularity?

SELECT track_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name LIKE '%you%'
ORDER BY popularity DESC;
